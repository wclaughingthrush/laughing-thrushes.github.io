We are excited to announce that we have recently acquired some beautiful land in the heart of the Kumaon Mountains, in the picturesque village of Nathuakhan. This land will be the site of our new homestay, and we can't wait to share it with you.

Located at a height of 1940 meters, our land offers breathtaking views of the Himalayas and a chance to reconnect with nature. The surrounding area is rich in culture and history, with nearby towns and villages offering a taste of local life and a glimpse into the past.

But what really sets our land apart is its location in the heart of the Kumaon Mountains. These majestic peaks offer endless opportunities for adventure, from hiking and mountain biking to exploring the many hidden gems of the region. Whether you're an adventure seeker or just looking to escape the city and relax, our land is the perfect place for you.

So join us at our new homestay, and experience the magic of the mountains for yourself. We can't wait to welcome you and show you all that our beautiful land has to offer.
